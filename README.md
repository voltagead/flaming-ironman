# VOLTAGE Development Guidelines
Internal Information for use by Voltage

## Standards Change Policy
Our standards are well-enough established that the only changes necessary will be to accommodate unforeseen problems or new technologies. A “simple” change should have good, specific reasons. This is more pertaining to changing a big standard like spacing, quotes, etc. If we change a standard, that makes any code from Voltage for the last months “non-standard” so we’ll continue to have mixed standards in our files as we go back to change things.
