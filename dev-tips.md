Hi Voltage Developers! Now that we are all masters of Sublime Text, how about we start getting some tips on all things dev. Today, I want to share a must have tip on Chrome's Developer Tools. If you are using Chrome's DevTools to debug Javascript or test new CSS styles on a web page while editing files (in Sublime no doubt), it's important not to let the browser cache throw you off between page refreshes. Luckily, there is a setting that can disable the browser cache while DevTools is open!

To turn on this setting:
1. Open DevTools
2. Press F1 to open Preferences options.
3. Check "Disable cache (while DevTools is open) which is located under the Network section on the top right.
4. Close the Preferences options.

Of course you can always use a Chrome extension to clear your cache with a single click as well like you can find here: https://goo.gl/CTxUxP
