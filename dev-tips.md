Hi Voltage Developers! Now that we are all masters of Sublime Text, how about we start getting some tips on all things dev. Today, I want to share a must have tip on Chrome's Developer Tools. If you are using Chrome's DevTools to debug Javascript or test new CSS styles on a web page while editing files (in Sublime no doubt), it's important not to let the browser cache throw you off between page refreshes. Luckily, there is a setting that can disable the browser cache while DevTools is open!

To turn on this setting:
1. Open DevTools
2. Press F1 to open Preferences options.
3. Check "Disable cache (while DevTools is open) which is located under the Network section on the top right.
4. Close the Preferences options.

Of course you can always use a Chrome extension to clear your cache with a single click as well like you can find here: https://goo.gl/CTxUxP

Happy Voltage Friday everyone! To compliment the last tip on clearing your cache when Chrome DevTools is open, I wanted to highlight this Clear Cache plugin. It's the easiest clear cache and refresh button around for when DevTools is closed.

Download the pluggin here:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clear-cache/cppjkneekbjaeellbfkmgnhonkkjfpdn?hl=en

After you install the plugin, checkout the options by right clicking on the icon. Make sure that "Automatically reload active tab after clearing data" is checked and the Time Period is set to "Everything".

Last, set a keyboard shortcut for fast access! Shortcuts can be configured at the >bottom< of the Chrome Extensions page by selecting Keyboard shortcuts here chrome://extensions/.

Welcome back to a great new week Voltage! So have you ever been trying to debug some Javascript that shows up just before the page is unloaded? Well, just hit the refresh key a bunch and try to read the text flash from the console error. Just kidding! There is actually a much simpler way. Chrome DevTools has a setting in plain view called "Preserve Log" which will make the console log persist instead of clearing on every page load.

Hola Voltaje Desarrolladores! You know that old saying "a screenshot speaks a thousand lines of code" or something like that? Well luckily Chrome has a really useful plugin to screen capture all or part of any web page. The plugin is called "Awesome Screenshot" and can be installed from here: https://goo.gl/9EdO5h

There are a couple of great features this plugin offers beyond just capturing a page. It also lets you add annotations, comments, *blur sensitive info*, and share with one-click uploads!
