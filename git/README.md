# Git Standards and Best Practices

Standards, suggestions and best practices for working with git.

## Standards

- Markdown files must always end with lowercase `.md`.
- Readme markdown files must always be named `README.md` (case sensitive)

## Useful commands

- `git config core.ignorecase false` - When renaming files in git to a different "case", by default git will not track the changes. This will force git to track those changes.
