Hello Voltage Force! I am going to try to post here each work day on #Development; along with a copy in Flaming-Ironman / Sublime section, on different tips, tricks, features, and helpful packages to help us become expert Sublime coders.

Today I wanted to talk about how to sort CSS. Most of the time we don't care how CSS properties are sorted, but putting them in a particular order will make your code more organized. I usually try to organize my property order by groups like font related, size/padding/margin related, etc but sorting them alphabetically can really do wonders when glancing at the code. It should even help to prevent duplicate properties getting added.

In SublimeText, you can select CSS properties and then hit ( F5 on Mac ) || ( F9 on PC ) to sort the properties alphabetical.
